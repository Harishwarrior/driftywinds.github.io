# altsource-viewer
View your favorite AltStore source.

## Get Started
Simply paste in the URL of an AltStore source to begin. [Try it here](https://therealfoxster.github.io/altsource-viewer/search)!

**Note**: If a source can't be viewed, it is highly likely due to a CORS restriction set by the server hosting the JSON file. To my knowledge, a JSON file hosted on GitHub (via GitHub Pages) does not have this problem. Regardless, feel free to open a new issue if you find any.
